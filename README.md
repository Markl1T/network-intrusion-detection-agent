# Network Intrusion Detection Agent

## Project Overview
This project implements an intelligent network intrusion detection system using a multi-stage AI approach:

0. **Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (Stage 0)**
   - Isolation Forest is trained on benign traffic to detect anomalies (potential attacks).

1. **Binary Classification (Stage 1)**
   - XGBoost and Random Forest models classify traffic as **Benign** or **Malicious**.

2. **Multiclass Attack Classification (Stage 2)**
   - If traffic is malicious, a second XGBoost and RandomForest model predicts the type of attack (e.g., Exploits, Backdoor, DoS, etc.).

The pipeline is accessible via a **Streamlit web interface** where users can input flow features or generate random samples for testing. You can select either Stage 0, Stage 1 or both models for detecting malicious traffic, and then Stage 2 model for classifying the type of attack.

## Live Demo
The Streamlit application is available at:
https://network-intrusion-detection-agent.streamlit.app/


## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the Repository
```bash

2. Download the NF-UNSW-NB15-V2 dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sankurisrinath/nf-unsw-nb15-v2csv/data) and put it in /data folder

3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Launch Streamlit app
```bash
streamlit run src/app.py
```

## AI Methodologies

### Unsupervised Learning
 - **Isolation Forest**

   - Trained only on benign flows to detect anomalous network behavior without requiring labeled attacks.

### Supervised Learning
 - **Binary Classifier with XGBoost/RandomForest**

   - Classifies traffic as Benign or Malicious based on labeled dataset features.

 - **Multiclass Classifier with XGBoost/RandomForest**
 
   - Predicts specific attack type using malicious flow features. Encodes the attack labels using a LabelEncoder.


## Notes

Streamlit interface uses only the most important features for user input, other features are filled automatically for model compatibility.

Random flows are sampled from a pool of benign and malicious traffic to simulate realistic testing.
